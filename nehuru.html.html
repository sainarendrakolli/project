              <p>  Jawaharlal Nehru was a prominent political figure in the Indian independence movement and the first Prime Minister of independent India. Born on November 14, 1889, in Allahabad, British India, Nehru hailed from a distinguished family and was educated in England. He studied at Harrow and Cambridge, where he developed an interest in nationalist politics and socialism. Nehru's exposure to the ideas of Fabian socialism and his association with the Indian National Congress (INC) shaped his political ideology.</p>

<p>Nehru played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence, advocating for a secular and socialist vision for the nation. He became a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi and actively participated in civil disobedience movements and protests against British rule. Nehru's commitment to democratic principles and his eloquence made him a prominent leader within the Congress Party. When India gained independence in 1947, Nehru assumed the role of the first Prime Minister.</p>

<p>As Prime Minister, Nehru faced the immense task of nation-building and steering India through its early years as a sovereign nation. He implemented ambitious economic and social policies, emphasizing industrialization, land reforms, and the establishment of educational institutions. Nehru's vision for a modern, secular, and socialist India is encapsulated in the term "Nehruvian socialism." However, his leadership also faced challenges, including conflicts with Pakistan and the China-India border dispute.</p>

<p>Jawaharlal Nehru's influence extended beyond his political career, as he left a lasting impact on the shaping of India's identity. His daughter, Indira Gandhi, and grandson, Rajiv Gandhi, also served as Prime Ministers, further contributing to the Nehru-Gandhi political legacy in India. Nehru's legacy remains a subject of both admiration and criticism, with ongoing debates about the effectiveness of his policies and their impact on the country's development.</p>
